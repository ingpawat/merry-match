# Merry Match

Merry Match is a new generation of online dating website for everyone.

Merry Match is a dating web application platform that was developed by a team of skilled professionals in three sprints over the course of one month. I was responsible for working on the front-end portion of the project using technologies such as React, Javascript, and TailwindCSS. The project utilized modern frameworks and databases such as Vite, ChakraUI, Axios, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL to ensure a seamless and efficient user experience. Unfortunately, the project has not yet been deployed.
